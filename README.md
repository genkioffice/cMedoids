# cMeans
This project is also for the future work of the implementaition of fuzzy cMedoids algorithm. For users who want to use fuzzy cMeans(FCM) algorithm also can utilize this repository. 

## requirements
You can find required libraries in requirements.txt. Also, this library only support python3. 

## example
To see what you can do with cMeans, you can have a look at cmeans_test in notebook directory.
